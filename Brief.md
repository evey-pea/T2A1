## Introduction

As a developer (dev) you are sometimes required to prove your knowledge to prospective clients and employers.

A common way clients assess this for a specific project is to release a Request for Quotation (RfQ). A RfQ can take many forms, but in general it is a questionnaire covering technical and commercial topics. This Workbook emulates the technical section of a RfQ.

## Brief

The ACME Corporation is interested in building a marketplace web application (app) using Rails for one of it’s product lines. To help it choose the vendor who will undertake the project they have released a RfQ. As an aspiring junior dev at an up and coming Sydney software startup (CAx-Dev) your manager has assigned you to assist with preparation of the RfQ response.

You are assigned (required) to complete all the questions from the technical section of the RfQ - which are presented below.

Being a highly valued junior dev you are expected to continue working on your other ongoing projects and schedule time for this project accordingly.

## Requirements

Requirements for this project are as follows,

**1** Documentation

### Documentation Requirements

Documentation for this project must be supplied as part of the following document(s),

**2** README document

### README document

Project documentation is to be compiled as a single markdown file named README.md. This file should contain,
