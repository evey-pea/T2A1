ACME Corporation is very big on project management, documentation and process. This will be a key metric in their decision to award the project. The following set of questions relate to this RfQ-requirement.

## Q3    Discuss the implementation of Agile project management methodology

Agile project management consists of a development team with defined roles and strategies that determine their level of involvement. It was originally defined in [The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html) in 2001. The focus of the 12 principles in the manifesto is on building working code frequently rather than to documentation heavy specifications.

### User

The user is the basic and most necessary role in the Agile process as the Agile process is used to create software from a user's need point of view. Often they are defined as personas. Each persona is created with the roles of the software usage (workflow) in mind. From the combination of the persona definition, the workflow and desired outcome a series of user stories are extrapolated. These user stories are then used to guide the design of software. Both the story and the software are reviewed to determine if the user's need has been met.

### Product Owner

At its simplest definition, the product owner is the person who becomes the voice of the customer. They are responsible for collaborating with the userbase and directing the work of the software development team to ensure the user's needs are met. 

With or without a literal userbase, the product owner would usually utilise a product vision and break it down into definitions of the user personas, workflow and desired outcomes. They would seek feedback from a userbase to refine the user stories on a continual basis. With this information they will prioritise the user stories and interface with the development team to ensure that the development team has a clear understanding of what is required in the final product.

### Development Team

The development team's role is to focus on building working software, usually as a series of smaller projects. Each project is demoed and reviewed by the team on a regular basis according to the priorities of the product owner.

To achieve this, it is essential that the team be multidisciplinary to have the maximum output from the team both as a whole and as individual contributors. Each member functions as a collaborator with set tasks. The disciplines required of each member can and often varies depending on the task.

### Strategies

The two most common Agile strategies are Scrum and Kanban.

#### Scrum

Scrum is based off a need to develop components quickly on a daily basis. The person leading the Scrum is either a product manager or someone who is designated as a 'scrum master'.

It usually begins with a 'stand up' meeting at the start of each day. Priorities and decided upon and Tasks are assigned to team members. At the end of each day a review is conducted to see what worked and what can be improved upon.

#### Kanban

Kanban is takes a more structured approach then Scrum. With each user story broken down, and a list of tasks is set. Team members are assigned tasks and mark them off as they are completed before taking on another task. The resulting work is then reviewed and reassigned if needed until it meets the product vision and user needs.

#### Other strategies

Agile methodolgy can include other strategies which include but are not limited to:

- Hybrid Agile/Waterfall/Architect type strategies where the approach is decided on each project's needs and complexity
- Test driven development to have functionality deliver the expected results as the code base changes
- Adopting internal or external technical standards to ensure consistent code is made with quality, security, naming conventions and so forth in mind.
